## **Author:** Kiran kumar siripurapu 
## **PDK:** Sky130A  
## **Flow Used:** OpenLane (RTL → GDSII)**

---

## 📘 Overview

This project implements the `spm` (small processing module) design using the OpenLane RTL-to-GDSII flow on the Sky130A open-source PDK.  
The goal was to take the given RTL and harden it into a complete ASIC layout, ending with a clean GDSII.

This report includes:
- RTL  
- Synthesis results  
- OpenLane logs  
- Magic screenshots  
- DRC, STA, CVC results  
- Final GDS & DEF  

The entire flow was completed inside GitHub Codespaces.

# 🧩 1. RTL Design

The RTL file used:

`/home/vscode/Desktop/OpenLane/designs/spm/submission/RTL/spm.v`


No RTL modifications were required for this project.
# ⚙️ 2. Synthesis (Yosys)

Synthesis was completed successfully using Yosys inside the OpenLane flow.

The synthesis stage generated:
- Synthesized netlist  
- Area reports  
- Timing reports  
- SDF (Standard Delay Format)  
- Cell usage statistics  

All synthesis outputs are stored in:  `submission/Synthesis/`


The synthesis stage completed successfully and produced:
- Synthesized netlist  
- Area and timing reports  
- SDF (Standard Delay Format)

# 🧱 3. OpenLane Flow Summary

The entire OpenLane RTL-to-GDSII flow was successfully executed for the `spm` design.
Each stage completed without fatal errors, and final signoff checks passed.

### ✔ Flow Stages Completed

| OpenLane Stage | Status |
|----------------|--------|
| Synthesis | ✔ Done |
| Floorplan | ✔ Done |
| Placement | ✔ Done |
| Clock Tree Synthesis (CTS) | ✔ Done |
| Routing | ✔ Done |
| GDSII Generation | ✔ Done |
| DRC (Magic) | ✔ 0 Errors |
| STA (OpenSTA) | ✔ Slack Met |
| CVC (Connectivity Check) | ✔ Passed |

All OpenLane-generated files (DEF, GDS, results, reports, logs) are stored under:`submission/OpenLane/`

# 🗺️ 4. Floorplan

The floorplan stage automatically generated:

- Core boundary  
- IO pin placement  
- Power Distribution Network (PDN)  
- Standard cell rows  
- Tapcells and decap insertion  

Floorplan reports are available in:

`submission/OpenLane/reports/floorplan/`
# ⚙️ 5. Placement & Clock Tree Synthesis (CTS)

The placement stage completed successfully with no congestion issues.  
Standard cells were placed and legalized across the floorplan.

Clock Tree Synthesis (CTS) inserted buffers and generated a balanced clock tree for timing closure.

All related reports are stored in:

- `submission/OpenLane/reports/placement/`
- `submission/OpenLane/reports/cts/`
# 🔧 6. Routing

Routing was completed using FastRoute and TritonRoute.  
The final routed DEF, parasitic extraction files, and timing data were generated successfully.

Final routing-related outputs are available in:

`submission/OpenLane/results/final/`
# 🖼️ 7. Magic Layout Screenshots

# 🧪 8. DRC (Design Rule Check)

Magic DRC was performed on the final layout.

**Final Result:**  
**Total DRC errors = 0**



All DRC reports are stored in:

`submission/Physical_Verification/`
# 🧬 9. CVC (Connectivity Verification Check)

CVC (Circuit Validity Checker) was run on the final extracted layout.  
It checks for:

- Shorts  
- Opens  
- Floating nodes  
- Incorrect connections  
- Power/ground issues  

**CVC passed successfully.**

### CVC Screenshot

Static Timing Analysis was performed on the final routed design.

Both **setup** and **hold** timing checks were MET.

# 🗂️ 11. Final Signoff Reports

The final signoff stage generated all required verification outputs, including:

- DRC reports  
- CVC reports  
- STA reports  
- SPEF (parasitics)  
- SDF  
- Extraction feedback  
- Additional OpenLane multi-corner analysis (mca) folders  

### Signoff Reports

`submission/Physical_Verification/`
# 🧾 12. Final GDS & DEF

The final fabrication-ready layout files are included in the submission.

### GDSII File:
`submission/OpenLane/gds/spm.gds`

### DEF File:
`submission/OpenLane/def/spm.def`

These files represent the final placed, clocked, and routed physical layout of the `spm` design.
